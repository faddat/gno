A utility realm doesn't map to a person, instead, it maps to an application.  Utility realms have an economic model with three fee components:

* Storage
* Computation
* Authorship (optional)

A utility realm can be paid for and preserved by the stream of funds provided by its users in the form of fees.  Authors of utility realms are permitted to include fees for their authorship of the module.  This is to ensure that popular realms, despite being open soruce, produce a stream of revenue for their creators.

**Public Utility Realms**
