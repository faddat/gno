<br>
<br>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">For those 
who don’t know, Michael Aquino was a Psychological Warfare Specialist in
 the US Army from 1968 until 1990, when he was involuntarily discharged 
as a result of investigations into his involvement in the ritual sexual 
abuse of children at the Presidio Day Care Center in San Francisco. 
Throughout this same time, he has also been a devout satanist and 
self-confessed neo-Nazi. He joined Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan in 
1969, staying until 1975 when he left to start his own Temple of Set, 
which has been in operation ever since. </span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , monospace;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Please
 note here that both psyops and satanism involve using many levels of 
deception and coercion to manipulate the perceptions of others for 
ulterior motives, so these are skills that Aquino is very familiar with 
and very comfortable in using. He is also an expert in propaganda and 
skilled in </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">techniques
 for disseminating misinformation/disinformation, and using 
misdirection, confusion tactics, isolation techniques, and revisionism. 
Therefore, he will certainly use these skills to defend himself against 
the truth of his actions. </span></span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , monospace;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Michael
 Aquino explains that his name keeps coming up in pedophile-ring cases 
because he’s the victim of a conspiracy (a ‘black bag job’, as he calls 
it). He bases this on the fact that he’s a satanist and so people just 
automatically hate him because of it. Unfortunately for him, making such
 a bad choice in lifestyle and philosophy doesn’t excuse him from 
anything, although in his particular case it certainly </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><i>does </i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">lend weight to the allegations against him and even </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><i>invites </i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">them,
 so he shouldn’t really complain about it. He tends to keep his 
perceptions of all this bad publicity focused strictly on the Presidio 
child abuse case in which he was a central figure during the 1980s, 
since that’s the only one he’s ever had to legally defend himself 
against (so far). Even in this one isolated case, he only dares to focus
 on it as far as his own limited version of the facts go, and he totally
 avoids acknowledging the larger body of evidence that implicates him 
personally. Similarly, he totally overlooks the longer history of events
 he’s been implicated in by various sources who are far removed from one
 another and who couldn’t possibly be engaged in any sort of conspiracy 
against him. </span></span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Whatever 
the case, I’m not going to attempt to detail all of the evidence against
 Michael Aquino here, since there’s far too much of it for this short 
article. I merely want to put his claim of conspiracy into proper 
perspective, in order to show how absurd it really is. </span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Time after 
time, Michael Aquino has been pointed at as a ruthlessly evil defiler 
and abuser of the most innocent and defenseless among us – young 
children – and it was as early as 1980 that the putrid history of his 
involvement in pedophilia and mind control can be traced back to (at 
least in the public records), but it probably goes back much further. 
The following provides a short historical record of events that ties 
Aquino to a larger criminal syndicate operating through the US 
government, and reveals his position within it. </span></div>

<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>1967 </b></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">– Michael Aquino began a two-year tour of duty in Vietnam, taking part in the infamous Phoenix Program. The Phoenix Program wa</span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">s
 an assassination/torture/terror operation that was initiated by the 
CIA, with the aim of ‘neutralizing’ the civilian infrastructure that 
supported the Viet Cong insurgency in South Vietnam. It was a terrifying
 ‘final solution’ that blatantly violated the Geneva Conventions. 
Targets for assassination included VC tax collectors, supply officers, 
political cadre, local military officials, and suspected sympathizers. 
However, ‘faulty intelligence’ more often than not led to the murder of 
innocent civilians, even young children. Sometimes orders were even 
given to kill US military personnel who were considered security risks. 
In 1971, William Colby, head of CIA in Vietnam at the time, later 
testified that the number killed was 20,857, while South Vietnamese 
government figures claimed it was 40,994 dead. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">This
 murderous psyop program had the effect of creating legions of 
cold-blooded psychopathic killers who would return home to the USA as 
completely different people than when they left. Many of them would 
become involved in satanism during or after their involvement in the 
Phoenix Program. And Michael Aquino was there to lead them into it. Soon
 after these killers started coming home, there began a steady rise in 
horrific serial murders with satanic undertones that centered around the
 southern California area (where Michael Aquino has always lived). </span></span></div>

<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , monospace;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>1980 </b></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">–
 According to sworn testimony given before a US Senate in later years, 
MKULTRA mind-control victim Cathy O’Brien claimed that she was 
programmed at </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Fort Campbell, Kentucky, </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">in 1980 </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">by
 Lt. Col. Michael Aquino of the US Army. She stated that Aquino used 
barbaric trauma techniques on both her daughter Kelly and herself that 
involved NASA technology. Cathy O’Brien claimed that she was a 
‘presidential model’ Monarch sex slave, meaning that she was specially 
programmed to cater to the sexual perversions of the highest-ranking 
politicians in the USA. She stated that during her time as a sex slave 
(which started as a child), she serviced a number of well-known 
politicians, including both Bill and Hilary Clinton, Ronald Reagan, 
Pierre Trudeau, Brian Mulroney, George H.W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Governors
 Lamar Alexander and Richard Thornburgh, Bill Bennett, Senator Patrick 
Leahy, Senator Robert Byrd (who she says was her handler) and Arlen 
Spector. O'Brien eventually gave testimony before the US Senate 
regarding the events she was forced to go through, and although she 
named her perpetrators, not one of them dared to challenge her or accuse
 her of slander. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>1982 (September 5) </b></span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">– Twelve-year-old </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Johnny
 Gosch was abducted from a shopping mall parking lot in West Des Moines,
 Iowa, while doing his early-morning paper route, never to be seen 
again. Years later, during an interview with private investigator Ted 
Gunderson, child abductee and sex slave victim Paul Bonacci revealed 
that, as a child, he was directly involved in Gosch’s abduction, having 
acted as a lure to draw Gosch into the hands of his pedophile abductors.
 According to Bonacci, the abduction was ordered by </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Lt. Col. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Michael
 Aquino, who later picked Gosch up at a farmhouse he was being held at 
and delivered him to a buyer in Colorado. For years, both boys were used
 for the pedophiliac pleasures of high-ranking government officials. </span></span></div>

 emerged regarding sexual abuse being perpetrated at the US Army’s 
Presidio Child Development Center in San Francisco. Within a year, at 
least 60 victims were identified, all between the ages of three and 
seven. Victims told of being taken to private homes to be abused, and at
 least three houses were positively identified, one of them being 
Aquino’s. They also described being urinated and defecated upon, and 
being forced to ingest urine and feces. Irrefutable medical evidence 
documented the fact that these children were sexually abused, including 
five who had contracted chlamydia, and many others who showed clear 
signs of anal and genital trauma consistent with violent penetration. 
Even before the abuse was exposed, the children were exhibiting radical 
changes in behavior, including temper outbursts, sudden mood shifts, and
 poor impulse control. Both Lt. Col Michael Aquino and his satanist wife
 Lilith were positively identified by victims as two of the 
perpetrators. At least one victim was able to positively identify 
Aquino's home and describe with uncanny accuracy the distinctively 
satanic interior of the house. Only one person was ever charged for the 
abuse of one child, and these charges were dismissed three months later.

 The US Army received allegations of child abuse at fifteen of its day 
care centers and several elementary schools. There were also at least 
two other cases at Air Force day care centers, and another one at a 
center run by the US Navy. In addition to these, a special team of 
experts were sent to Panama to help determine if as many as ten children
 at a Department of Defense elementary school were molested and possibly
 infected with AIDS. Another case also emerged in a US-run facility in 
West Germany. These cases occurred at some of the most esteemed military
 bases in the country, including Fort Dix, Fort Leavenworth, Fort 
Jackson, and West Point. In the West Point case alone, by the end of the
 year, fifty children were interviewed by investigators. There were 
reports of satanic acts, animal sacrifices, and cult-like behavior among
 the abusers. An investigation led by former US Attorney Rudolph 
Giuliani produced no federal grand jury indictments. His investigation 
concluded that only one or two children were abused, in spite of all the
 evidence to the contrary. </span></span></div>

 The FBI raided the Franklin Credit Union in Omaha, Nebraska, run by a 
man named Lawrence King. In the process, they uncovered evidence 
relating to drug running, pedophilia, pornography, and satanic activity 
involving prominent individuals in the local community and beyond. 
Eighty children eventually came forward and identified many of those 
involved, including the chief of police (who impregnated one of the 
victims), a local newspaper publisher, a former vice squad officer, a 
judge, and others. The children described satanic ceremonies involving 
human and animal sacrifice. Evidence that came out showed that children 
were abducted from shopping mall parking lots and auctioned off in Las 
Vegas and Toronto. Airplanes owned by the DEA were often used to 
transport the children. Other children were removed from orphanages and 
foster homes and taken to Washington, DC to take part in sex orgies with
 </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">dignitaries,
 congressmen, and other high-ranking public officials. A number of the 
child victims testified that George Bush Sr. was one of the people who 
was often seen at these parties. Photographs were being surreptitiously 
taken at these orgies by the child traffickers for blackmail purposes. 
There was also evidence of ties to mind-control programs being conducted
 at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, where the head of the 
Strategic Air Command (SAC) is located. Minot is an area that has 
satanic cults operating in it that have been directly tied to the Son of
 Sam and Manson murders, among others. </span></span></div>

<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">There was 
no follow-up investigation when these findings were made. The US 
national media didn’t report on the story. Local media only focused on 
discrediting the witnesses. The FBI and other enforcement officers 
harassed and discredited victims in the aftermath, causing all but two 
of them – Paul Bonacci and Alisha Owen – to recant their testimonies. 
The child victims, rather than the perpetrators, were thrown in prison. 
Alisha Owen spent more time in solitary confinement than any other woman
 in the history of the Nebraska penal system. She received a sentence of
 9 to 25 years for allegedly committing perjury, which is ten years 
longer than the sentence that was given to Lawrence King for looting his
 Franklin Credit Union of $40 million. This heavy sentence imposed on 
Owen was meant to serve as a warning message to all other victims who 
might think of talking. </span></div>

delivering evidence to Senator Loran Schmit. His briefcase went missing 
from the wreckage. This was the first of many deaths of people 
attempting to uncover this politically connected satanic cult/sex 
slave/drug trafficking ring. The Discovery Channel made a documentary 
about this case, entitled ‘Conspiracy of Silence’, but at the last 
moment, a group of unidentified US Congressmen paid them $500,000 to not
 air it, and all copies were destroyed (one copy survived). Republican 
senator John DeCamp, who was on the investigative committee, wrote a

Colonel’. Rusty Nelson, King’s personal photographer, also identified 
Aquino as the man that he once saw King give a briefcase full of money

 never formally charged, according to court documents, Aquino was 
‘titled’ in a Report of Investigation by the Army’s Criminal

 The child abuse charges remained against Aquino because, according to 
the CID, the evidence of alibi offered by Aquino “was not persuasive.” </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Aquino has since denied that he was ever processed out of the Army and even claims that he </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">was
 selected as one of their first Space Intelligence Officers during this

active duty before retiring. There is no evidence that this is true. </span></span></div>

 (Although this entry isn’t directly connected to Michael Aquino, it 
directly relates to the cover up of events that he and his pedophile 
cronies have been involved in.) After being accused of molestation as a 
child by their daughter, Peter and Pamela Freyd established the False 
Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF). The original board members included 
doctors who were directly involved in MKULTRA mind-control programs, 
such as expert hypnotist Martin Orne and Dr. Louis Jolyin West, as well 
as many others who have been accused of child sexual abuse. One board 
member, </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Richard Ofshe, is an alleged expert on coercive persuasion</span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">
 techniques, and another, Margaret Singer, was a government expert on 
cults and cult tactics. Elizabeth Loftus is an expert on memory. The 
mandate of the FMSF has always been to discredit the recovered memories 
of people who report having been traumatically abused as children – 
usually by claiming that the child’s therapist has implanted false 
memories – and to develop legal defenses for protecting pedophiles in 
court. They have resorted to lies, intimidation, character 
assassination, legal tactics, and coercing victims to recant their 
claims and sue their therapists for large settlements. The FMSF has 
routinely argued in court cases that satanic ritual abuse (SRA) and 
multiple personality disorder (MPD) don’t exist, and the organization 
and its members have specifically targeted any therapists who claim that
 they do. This defense strategy, which has proven to be quite 
successful, has allowed victims of trauma-based mind-control and ritual 
abuse to be completely discredited, while allowing their perpetrators to
 continue their activities unimpeded. </span></span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">At about 
the time that the FMSF was established, a number of mind-control and 
ritual abuse victims were starting to remember being involved in these 
events, and this threatened to expose the perpetrators, so it was 
important that a means to discredit them was put in place. </span></div>
<div align="justify">

<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The False 
Memory Syndrome Foundation was created by known pedophiles and its board
 was fortified with CIA mind-control experts who cut their teeth on 
MKULTRA victims. Many of them are known to be closely associated with 
Michael Aquino. This organization of pedophiles and mind-control experts
 have been very instrumental in covering for Aquino and other pedophiles
 while destroying the lives and careers of their victims, the victim’s 
families, and their therapists, even long after these pedophiles 
performed their vile acts against them. </span></div>

 Diana Napolis was a Child Protection Services investigator in San Diego
 who was alarmed by the increasing number of children who were reporting
 satanic ritual abuse, starting as far back as the mid-1980s. Napolis 
went undercover online in 1995 and approached Aquino and several others 
who were associated with him, while also posting information and 
evidence relating to these crimes and these people’s involvement in 
them. In response, Aquino and his associates (several of them from the 
False Memory Syndrome Foundation) cyber-stalked Napolis for five years 
and finally tracked her down in 2000, thereby discovering her real 
identity. At this point, Napolis’ efforts to expose these people were 
defeated, with Aquino and associates using their power and influence to 
pose themselves as the victims and accusing </span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><i>her </i></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">of
 cyber-stalking, as well as engaging in assassinating her character both
 online and through the media. Napolis was also targeted with 
directed-energy weapons (V2K) and set up to appear mentally unstable, 
with claims that she was stalking various celebrities. This resulted in 
her spending a year in jail and several more months in a mental 
facility, and eventually being forced to quit her job. The character 
assassination continued against her, with someone claiming to be Napolis
 posting insane ravings on the internet in order to make her appear 
crazy. </span></span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">A reporter 
at the San Diego Union Tribune was working for Aquino and his cronies by
 painting Napolis in a bad light in news reports, accusing her of 
cyber-stalking, making threats, and acting crazy. Aquino was publicly 
complaining that she was causing serious problems for him and his fellow
 pedophiles. Nonetheless, the article at the first link below clearly 
reveals the one-sided reporting on this story by the San Diego Union 
Tribune and the fact that if anyone was being cyber-stalked, it was 
Napolis. The second link below is Napolis’ far more professional and 
believable response to the article:</span></div>

<br>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The point 
of going after Napolis so publicly served several agendas. First, it was
 a public warning to anyone else who might attempt to expose the 
increasing satanic ritual abuse that was going on and the people behind 
it. Second, it acted to deflate the satanic ritual abuse scare that was 
mounting, making it appear to be nothing more than the ravings of 
delusional people. Third, it assured that stealing other people’s 
children using child protection services could continue. Fourth, (with 
the help of the FMSF) it made out children’s claims of molestation and 
satanic ritual abuse to be nothing more than false memories. </span></div>

 US District Court in Lincoln, Nebraska, a hearing was held in the 
matter of Paul A. Bonacci v. Lawrence E. King, a civil action in which 
Bonacci charged that he had been ritualistically abused by King as part 
of a nationwide pedophile ring that was linked to powerful political 
figures in Washington and to elements of the US military and 
intelligence agencies. </span></span></div>
<div align="justify">

<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">During the 
hearing, Noreen Gosch, whose twelve-year-old son Johnny had been 
abducted in 1982, provided the court with sworn testimony linking US 
Army Lt. Col. Michael Aquino to the nationwide pedophile ring. She 
stated:</span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div style="margin-left: 1.27cm;" align="justify">
“<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Well, 
then there was a man by the name of Michael Aquino. He was in the 
military. He had top Pentagon clearances. He was a pedophile. He was a 
Satanist. He's founded the Temple of Set. And he was a close friend of 
Anton LaVey. The two of them were very active in ritualistic sexual 
abuse. And they deferred funding from this government program to use 
[in] this experimentation on children. </span></div>
<div style="margin-left: 1.27cm;" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Where 
they deliberately split off the personalities of these children into 
multiples, so that when they're questioned or put under oath or 
questioned under lie detector, that unless the operator knows how to 
question a multiple-personality disorder, they turn up with no evidence.
 </span></div>
<div style="margin-left: 1.27cm;" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">They 
used these kids to sexually compromise politicians or anyone else they 
wish to have control of. This sounds so far out and so bizarre I had 
trouble accepting it in the beginning myself until I was presented with 
the data. We have the proof. In black and white."</span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Paul 
Bonacci, who was a victim of this nationwide pedophile crime syndicate, 
subsequently identified Aquino as the man who ordered the kidnapping of 
Johnny Gosch. </span></div>
<div align="justify">
<br></div>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Three weeks

<br>
<div align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The 
question here isn't whether Michael Aquino is guilty of being one of the
 world's most despicable pedophiles and mind-control programmers ever to
 crawl out of a toilet, which the evidence makes quite clear. Rather, 
the question is whether there is a conspiracy against him by all of 
these people (including young children) making these allegations against
 him over the years, and for what reason? After all, this is exactly 
what he claims to be the case, and this is how he has attempted to 
excuse these many claims against him. </span></div>

<div class="western" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Conspiracy 
or not, it certainly is quite unusual for his name to come up in so many
 cases of child abuse and sex slavery. I counted up to 200 child victims
 in the above listed events, all of who would have had to be carefully 
coached to lie without being tripped up by a more intelligent adult 
during questioning. And then there are all the doctors who were involved
 in examining these children and who claimed that many of them had 
definite physical signs of having been sexually violated, who would also
 have to be in on it. And there are also the children’s parents who 
would have had to have been either very easily deceived by their own 
children, or were in on the conspiracy as well. And of course, there are
 also all of the investigators, lawyers, judges, etc. who supposedly 
conspired against Aquino in the Presidio case. </span></div>
<div class="western" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></span></div>
<div class="western" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Occam’s 
Razor dictates that the simplest explanation that requires the least 
assumptions to be made is usually the most accurate one, and so Aquino’s
 explanation that he’s a victim of a conspiracy lacks any plausibility 
whatsoever when compared to the alternative explanation that all these 
people are speaking honestly and are supported by a very large amount of
 evidence that explains and exposes the inner machinations of the 
criminal syndicate that Aquino has been deeply involved in throughout 
his military career. This criminal syndicate has been central to all 
mind-control programs and all psychological operations that have been 
playing out on the American population since at least 1947, when the CIA
 was first established and its ranks filled with Paperclip Nazis and 
their fascist American sympathizers, soon after which the first 
mind-control programs began. These programs have been central to Michael
 Aquino’s position within the government as well as within this 
syndicate of criminals and pedophiles. This criminal syndicate requires 
psychopathic ‘Masters of Evil’ to handle certain aspects of their 
operations – people who are well trained in the psychological 
manipulation and physical torture and trauma of others to the point of 
breaking their wills completely in order to turn them into 
mind-controlled slaves to be used by this syndicate for their criminal 
activities and sick pleasures. Unlike anyone else, Michael Aquino has 
the necessary credentials for such a position. However, he’s only one 
among a much larger group of equally evil men and women involved in 
these activities. </span></div>
<div class="western" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></span></div>
<div class="western" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">This 
criminal syndicate, which involves a great many of the most powerful 
people in the world, is involved in blackmail, torture, murder, drug 
trafficking, arms trafficking, human trafficking, pornography, 
pedophilia, terrorism, and mind control. People like Michael Aquino, who
 have spent their life working for this syndicate, are completely 
protected from the law, and this is why they always manage to avoid 
being exposed and made to pay for their crimes. </span></div>
<div class="western" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></span></div>
<div class="western" align="justify">
<span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">If you know
 of any other cases of mind-control or pedophilia that involve Michael 
Aquino beyond those mentioned above, please let me know. This evil 
sub-human is getting old, and it wouldn’t be fair if he died before he 
gets what’s due him. </span></div>

 have wondered if "the satanic panic" cases were deliberately set up in 
the 1980s to prime the American populace to dismiss as "crazy" any 
individual or source who later claimed to have been abused "by 
Satanists". This seems not unlikely (it would be a common sense way to 
prevent the claims of real victims being believed)  and so my assumption
 is that this was done. I'm proof that it worked, because I was so 
deeply ignorant about reality that I continued to doubt the existence of
 actual, normal-IQ Satanists and ritual abuse until I had the horrible 
experience of learning about its reality firsthand. Since the early 90s 
anyone who makes these claims tends to be dismissed so quickly as 
"delusional" that most  Americans will not even consider checking out 
what they have to say. So....mission accomplished.<br><br>Whether Aquino
 and his associates are indeed "true believers", or whether this whole 
thing is something Aquino dreamed up as "theater" (in the interest of 
"national security"), does it really matter? After all, what would be 
the purpose of such theater (if indeed that is what it is)?  Well, one 
thing that might come about from founding one's own satanic sect and 
performing rituals at Himmler's old castle to summon up a new 
"knighthood of followers of Satan" ( this actually took place, with 
Aquino supplying that explanation) is unprecedented access to the most 
vile sociopaths in the country who'd be stupidly flattered and oh so 
eager to carry out whatever "operations" and "missions" Aquino dreamed 
up. And the whole problem of word leaking out would be nicely taken care
 of, since people who get into Satanism and later change their minds 
(i.e., want out) do not tend to do very well thereafter.<br><br>Can 
anyone help me understand: Why would a country like the USA (with all of
 our "moral authority") want a self-described Satanist and his "satanic 
Knighthood" having anything to do with Psychological Operations in the 
name of "national security"? Might some unsavory/immoral things go on 
with all that? Again, even if Aquino is just play-acting at being a 
Satanist we have to ask ourselves WHY.

Wow! (just kidding)...<br><br>I haven't read Bryant's book, but I just looked online and found some information from it that I'll look at. <br><br>An
 interesting thing that raises alarms is that John DeCamp, who was the 
first to break the Franklin story, was actually in the Phoenix Program 
in Vietnam, as was Aquino. This was an assassination program that was 
just incomprehensibly sick in the things that they did, and obviously 
turned many American soldiers into psychopaths who then came home at 
about the same time that serial killers and satanism started to make a 
scene. <br><br>Anyway, my point is that the Franklin story was 
apparently exposed as part of a larger psyop on the American people. Ted
 Gunderson, who was supposedly trying to expose satanism and the elite's
 pedophile ring was supposedly married to Anton LaVey's duaghter.for a 
while. He (and DeCamp) were apparently working for the dark side and 
throwing us a bone so that the larger problem would be ignored. I know I
 didn't explain that very well, but if I can find the information I had 
on this, I'll try to put it up on my blog. Don't expect it too soon, 
though. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=7503509090478454860">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c7503509090478454860-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c7503509090478454860-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c7503509090478454860-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="7503509090478454860" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c7503509090478454860-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c5435469354702176443"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/00961351693706153211" rel="nofollow">Johnny Genlock</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1522519894110#c5435469354702176443">March 31, 2018 at 11:11 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">I
 interviewed DeCamp back when he still had all his memory.  True, he was
 in the Phoenix Program. But also true, he married a Viet wife and had a
 family with her. The first interview he did with me, he thought it was 
going to be a radio interview. His young daughter had just finished 
cutting his hair using a bowl to trim the bangs.  He looked Godawful and
 was proud of it until he realized I had a camera.  But the measure of

 I believe it was one of LaVey's ex-wives / widows.  She had been 
pushing Ted for the marriage, telling him he was her hero and would he 
save her by marrying her, which lasted a few hours/days. Ted afterward 
felt her only purpose in seducing him was to destroy his reputation; 
which admittedly that did a lot with her proclaiming he could not

 people get married overnight. How do I know all this?  Ted actually

 I wouldn't have thought that about DeCamp or Gunderson, but then again 
I'll certainly no dismiss what you're saying. I read DeCamp's book on 
The Franklin thing, and was absolutely floored by the kinds of 
embarrassing errors that one finds throughout. I found myself feeling 
angry on behalf of the victims in Omaha and elsewhere, since they have 
been much further traumatized by a concerted effort to portray them as 
either delusional or pathologically dishonest. Out of concern that their
 stories be taken seriously I would have thought that DeCamp (an 
attorney and legislator) would have taken a bit more care with his book.
 However I believe that as it is it will only make things harder for the
 victims. Nick Bryant's "The Franklin Scandal", on the other hand, is 
really extraordinary; it truly makes me wince to see Bryant's name and 
work mentioned in the same breath with those of other "Franklin" 
writers. Since his book is impossible to mock or dismiss I have always 
found it "interesting" (i.e., disturbing) that it seems to get much less
 often mentioned than other, very inferior books. For example, Noreen 
Gosch's book "Why Johnny Can't Come Home" (co-written by John Zielinski 
--who's supposed to have written like 20 books?) is so poorly done that I
 honestly wondered about the histories/intentions of the authors. I feel
 horrible saying this, but when you have a subject this important how do
 you explain publishing something so weak? <br><br>Anyway, thank you for
 trying to get the word out about Aquino, et al. It certainly isn't easy
 to do; my experience is that even the most basic facts about his 
existence, his Temple of Set, and his position in the government have 
been more than anyone can even entertain as possible. Which brings me 
full circle to my point in my first post: that the whole 
High-Satanic-Priest-in-charge-of-Psyops bit was a brilliant way to 
ensure that educated, sane, unknowingly brainwashed people (like the old
 me) would never pose a challenge to get around, would never bother to 
seriously entertain the stories that came out about torture and bizarre 
secret abuses of citizens because they'd never allow for the possibility
 that such an individual could exist. They've been very well trained to 
look the other way and make jokes and judgments about the victims 
seeking help.  You can just hear them. So you're trying to tell me 
there's a former Breen Beret who dressed in the 1960s like LSD from the 
movie "The Producers" (minus the Campbell's soup can necklace)? And 
you're trying to tell me he is not just a neo-Nazi, but a card-carrying 
Satanist who looks like Grandpa from the Munsters? And he's supposedly 
slipped scot-free out of HOW many charges of child sexual abuse, yet 
he's still top brass and still enjoys top security clearance, etc?  When
 (here's the beauty part) everyone who made it through 4th grade "KNOWS 
that there is no such thing as Satanic abuse or other crime" (that's 
what the TV and papers say), and that anyone guilty of asserting 
otherwise has been proven to be a pathetic loser who still has a 
"Satanic Panic" mentality?  Truly it seems to me that Aquino's  
theatrics (sincere or insincere) have been all about ensuring that 
virtually nobody would dream of taking a look, of asking questions..  By
 the time anyone with any power  or resources bothers to look into 
anything it will be too late for too many people. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="8213894395327833264" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-539505707"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=8213894395327833264">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c8213894395327833264-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c8213894395327833264-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div><li class="comment" id="c1124116967856426970"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1395344765743#c1124116967856426970">March 20, 2014 at 12:46 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Just
 a quick note on Noreen Gosch... I recently came across some material 
that puts her in a bad light, based on another purported victim (I'll 
have to look at my notes on this later to get the name of the person so I
 can find links to it). There is definitely a major psyop/coverup giong 
on, so every piece of information that comes out has to be deakt with 
very carefully and not taken as truth just because it seems like it at 
the time. Michael Aquino is central to all of this, and he's a very 
skilled psyop specialist. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=1124116967856426970">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c1124116967856426970-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c1124116967856426970-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c1124116967856426970-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="1124116967856426970" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c1124116967856426970-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c9000924031661385490"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1395372093827#c9000924031661385490">March 20, 2014 at 8:21 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">I just checked the library shelves and found Nick Bryant's book, so I'll start reading it tonight.

 mick, I would like to recommend a book to you. It is called Rabbit 
Hole, a Satanic ritual abuse survivor's story. The author is named David
 Shurter. He has a blog under the same name. David has also made 
numerous youtube videos where he tours Omaha and shows and explains the 
exact locations of SRA ritual sites. David has identified the man that 
abducted Johnny Gosch, not Paul Bonnacci, the man that actually abducted
 J.G. and transported him. Rabbit Hole also exposes the Link between the
 Franlin scandal and the Penn State Scandal. (it is mind blowing) Rabbit
 Hole is not speculative, it is all the personal experience of the 
author.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="3946774896145553894" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-539505707"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=3946774896145553894">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c3946774896145553894-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c3946774896145553894-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div><li class="comment" id="c6018485715068943293"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/11594093718714798117" rel="nofollow">Christine Erikson (aka Justina)</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1403566722431#c6018485715068943293">June 23, 2014 at 4:38 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Didn't Bonacci say he did not kidnap Gosch, he lured him for the one who did kidnap him? </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1754662481"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=6018485715068943293">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c6018485715068943293-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c6018485715068943293-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c6018485715068943293-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="6018485715068943293" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c6018485715068943293-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c8973034830715450956"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1405375585480#c8973034830715450956">July 14, 2014 at 3:06 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">That's exactly what he said. he was only a teenager himself at the time. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=8973034830715450956">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c8973034830715450956-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c8973034830715450956-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c8973034830715450956-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="8973034830715450956" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c8973034830715450956-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6258727802227050047"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blank.gif" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user">Anonymous</cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439517176834#c6258727802227050047">August 13, 2015 at 6:52 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Paul

 recently become aware of David Shurter, although I've only read

 Bowart related an interview he did with Cathy O'Brien, where she 
recounted being brought in front of Manuel Noriega, had her breasts 
bared by Michael Aquino, and at his satanic invocation the figure of a 
baphomet would appear on her breast. This was being done to intimidate 
Noriega.  I ran into Cathy and Mark in Austin one time.  Mark said, 
"Bowart doesn't know what he's talking about. That wasn't burned in with
 Nitric Acid.  That was a branding iron. I could say a few words and 
bring it up right now." Then Mark realized what he had just disclosed.  
He continued, "If you had an old scar on your knee from sports; one 
that's gone now.  I could through suggesting bring that back up on your 
knee."  Good cover attempt, Mark. No sale. I love 'em, but he's not 
telling it straight. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-736991942"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=3552697016348117187">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c3552697016348117187-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c3552697016348117187-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c3552697016348117187-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="3552697016348117187" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c3552697016348117187-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c3857867050303286912"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/00961351693706153211" rel="nofollow">Johnny Genlock</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1522521986309#c3857867050303286912">March 31, 2018 at 11:46 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">I

 "child abuse" allegations concerning me are absolutely false and 
groundless: nothing more than "copycat" efforts by persons with either a
 vested interest or a personal fantasy about this topic. My wife and I 
were victimized in an attempted "SRA" scam by Army Chaplain Larry 
Adams-Thompson and his wife in the 1980s - a scam which failed. That was
 all, but the media sensationalism was enough to energize the lunatic 
fringe. If you want a fact sheet on the A-T scam, just email me at 
Xeper@sbcglobal.net and ask.  Nor was I dismissed from the Army; I 
retired in 2006, and in 1994 received the Meritorious Service Medal 
covering the entire previous decade. As for what the original 1966-75 
Chutch of Satan and 1975+ Temple of Set are actually "all about", see my
 extensive books about both on Amazon. I was never involved in MKULTRA, 
etc. If you want the detailed truth about my actual knowledge in the 
field of the mind, see my book _MindWar_. This [anonymous as typical] 
blogger could easily have contacted me instead of writing all these 
falsehoods. Evidently he was not interested in his hate-agenda being 
completely deflated.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5236490511462574320" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-911364794"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=5236490511462574320">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c5236490511462574320-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c5236490511462574320-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div><li class="comment" id="c3869147837020825315"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1398631158834#c3869147837020825315">April 27, 2014 at 1:39 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">You're

 is the one thing which will always "stick" to you Mr. Aquino, how could
 so many kids from so many different states and towns be involved in a 
conspiracy against you and your set. What you try to allege is simply 
statistically an anomaly, it is inconceivable, it is absolutely 
impossible to believe you in the face of so many children all fingering 
you as being present at one or more of their 
molestation/rape/torture/beating sessions. When looking at two 
possibilities of truth or lies, one only has to look at the option which
 is the easiest to explain. Meaning which option is more believable. Is 
it more believable that dozens of kids from dozens of separate locations
 with absolutely no knowledge of each other would all be in on a 
sinister plot concocted by a Christian along with hundreds of other 
doctors, law enforcement officials, attorneys, judges etc. etc. to bring
 down one Michael Aquino, or is it just slightly more plausible that 
with your military credentials and security clearances and your ability 
to come and go off the radar as often as you please with your vast array
 of willing minions to do your bidding whatever it may be, that you 
Michael Aquino have a very sick and twisted mind and soul who likes to 
have sex with little boys and girls and do terrible things to them like 
any old disgusting, scum of the earth pedophile would? You with the 
means, the mode, the minions, and an unlimited supply of funds available
 to you. I ask you which is the more plausible truth? It's not very hard
 to come to a logical decision on which option is the truth and which is
 the complete and total fabrication by you and your army of minions who 
are involved at every level which is why nothing has ever been done to 
you or your fellow participants in this ring of pedophilia and drugs. 
True to being an Aleister Crowley fan and wanting to be like him. To me,
 as I said at the beginning of this post, it comes down to that basic 
idea about the most believable option between the two choices of truth 
or lies. Which is more believable? I think I just explained which is 
more believable and which is likely the truth. Mr. Aquino you will meet 
your master one day soon and he will not be at all what you are 
expecting and how you spend your eternity will more than make up for the
 atrocities that you perpetrated on all of those innocent children. 
Jesus loved the children very much and was always found in their 
presence, you will be judged as such and I impatiently wait for the day 
when God's wraith is poured out on you for what you've done.........</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-539505707"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=5370740902527912646">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c5370740902527912646-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c5370740902527912646-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c5370740902527912646-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5370740902527912646" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c5370740902527912646-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c5328077112476898409"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1405376036576#c5328077112476898409">July 14, 2014 at 3:13 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Excellent
 post, Anonymous. That old fartbag Aquino the child abuser hasn't got 
the testicular fortitude to defend himself beyond what he had his 
lawyers put together as a format-letter response to these charges 
against him. I believe that in his old age he's starting to worry about 
what he'll meet on the 'other side'. I think he's in denial about his 
past criminal activity, and is desperately trying to convince himself 
and others who KNOW, that he's just a clown in a suit playing a part in a
 fantasy. He never amounted to the AntiChrist that he claimed to be. He 
knows he's doomed to go down in history as the evil, despicable piece of
 shit that he is. All across the internet and everywhere else, his deeds
 will remain to immortalize him as one of the biggest assholes of the 
twentieth century. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=5328077112476898409">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c5328077112476898409-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c5328077112476898409-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c5328077112476898409-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5328077112476898409" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c5328077112476898409-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c4345337963816131221"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/02030541850484862576" rel="nofollow">KabbalArt</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1440745390938#c4345337963816131221">August 28, 2015 at 12:03 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">It seems to me that you have Demonized a Satanist. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1546126151"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=4345337963816131221">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c4345337963816131221-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c4345337963816131221-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c4345337963816131221-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="4345337963816131221" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c4345337963816131221-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6316618558124426524"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1441050775412#c6316618558124426524">August 31, 2015 at 12:52 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">I

 Aquino is an intentional scapegoat for this criminal syndicate.  He is 
used to stalk these children and "show his face" at specific times to 
victims in order to get the victims to go public with what they 
experienced, and identitfy Aquino as being present.  When this happens, 
your case will run through the smokescreen that is initially set up, 
making "religious accusations" and "delusions" the main issues.  He is 
easily identifiable by children due to his very bizarre appearance, 
which is being done intentionally.<br><br>He is definently sadistic, and
 I do not doubt he is a pedophile.  He was in New Hope, MN, in Feberuary
 of 2013.  He did this whole "make an appearance and send you on a path 
of BS research" thing which I did.  I seem to be targeted by a criminal 
organization and it is a product of the psy-ops stalking by proxy 
operation.  <br><br>For some reason, it is a huge relief to know that Im
 a target of a government syndicate that is corrupt, as opposed to

 know that John DeCamp was involved in the Phoenix Program in Vietnam, 
as was Aquino. This definitely puts him in suspicion. Apparently Ted 
Gunderson was a double agent, acting to contain exposure of the satanic 
pedophile ring by pretending to work with the people exposing it while 
actually protecting the higher-ups. Note that nothing positive really 
ever came out of the work of these two. A few books were published, a 
few media stories were made (all debunking the claims), and it was all 
forgotten about while DeCamp went on to earn royalties and Gunderson 
went on to act like a hero. <br><br>BTW, many people forget or don't 
know that Gunderson was a big proponent of COINTELPRO tactics while he 
was in the FBI, and he had extensive counterintelligence training. For a
 short time he was apparently married to Anton LaVey's ex-wife and 
former high priestess of the Church of Satan. <br><br>As for Kenneth 
Anger and other OTO people, you must remember that the dark side is 
fluent in deception and will pose as the victims. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=2343441074232934836">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c2343441074232934836-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c2343441074232934836-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c2343441074232934836-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="2343441074232934836" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c2343441074232934836-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c8406194650984787482"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blank.gif" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user">Anonymous</cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439517539907#c8406194650984787482">August 13, 2015 at 6:58 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Anyone
 who works with the victims finds their self making compromises to help 
THIS victim, in THIS moment. He readily admitted that he had made 
mistakes along the way, taken gambles that did not pan out as he had 
hoped. I suspect that his marriage to the witch was amongst these. He 
was not perfect, far from it, but he did work tirelessly for the 
individual victims to whom he made a promise, often putting his own life
 in danger in the fulfillment of those promises. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-539505707"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=8406194650984787482">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c8406194650984787482-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c8406194650984787482-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c8406194650984787482-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="8406194650984787482" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c8406194650984787482-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c8483680188966632035"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439584441164#c8483680188966632035">August 14, 2015 at 1:34 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Are you talking about Michael Aquino?

 for your post, Anonymous. I agree that there are more people involved

 good reason to believe that Ted Gunderson and John DeCamp were really 
working together with Aquino and these others to contain and control

 As to why "many children have made allegations", the fact is that none 
has, because I have never abused any child. What happened *after* the 
media-circus Presidio attack (a $3 million attempted scam by parents) 
were a number of copycat attempts by other, similarly-motivated parents,
 period, all of which were exposed as exactly that. Today the "SRA" 
model of the 1980s has generally evolved into children accusing their 
own parents, relatives, or teachers/church leaders.<br><br>(2) As above, I was never expelled from the Army, but honorably retired from active service in 1994 by my own request. Download:<br><br>http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/PSFSummary.pdf<br><br>to see my retirement certificates.<br><br>(3) For the full, detailed, documented history of the original scam, see:<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/dp/1500159247<br><br>(4)
 Both the original 1966-75 Church of Satan and the 1975+ Temple of Set 
were/are completely legitimate institutions with neither any record nor 
any interest in law violations (including against children). If you want
 to exhaustively exmine their histories and philosophies:<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/dp/1494447339<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/dp/1497567459<br><br>(5)
 I have never been involved in any illegal or unethical "mind-control" 
activity such as MKULTRA. Indeed throughout my PSYOP career I have 
maintained a strong stand against such. For both my analyses of them and
 a detailed discussion of what I have done and do advocate:<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/dp/1484926455<br><br>(6)
 During the southeast Asian wars I was assigned to the 4th PSYOP Group, 
which did not administer or control the PHOENIX program. The Army's 
involvement with PHOENIX was through Military Intelligence (MI) 
detachments, not PSYOP units, which you can easily verify through 
Internet research.<br><br>(7) I've never been involed with any criminal 
gangs, conspiracies, or plots generally. Throughout my career I held 
compartmented security clearances above Top Secret, some of whose names 
were themselves classified. For such clearances the Defense 
Investigative Service examines your life with a microscope, and anything
 DIS doesn't like toasts you, plain and simple. I retained these 
clearances right up to my request for retirement. Q.E.D.<br><br>(8) I 
think that about covers it. Why do some cranks in the lunatic fringe 
work so hard to try to throw mud at me? The $cam era is over, so I 
presume just for their own malicious entertainment and sex fantasies, 
period.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="2216553822299202634" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-911364794"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=2216553822299202634">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c2216553822299202634-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c2216553822299202634-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c2216553822299202634-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="2216553822299202634" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c2216553822299202634-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c7239913972810468121"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15550293698047633982" rel="nofollow">Unknown</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1432529054421#c7239913972810468121">May 24, 2015 at 9:44 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Niec page my friend<br><br><br><a href="http://www.pelicancase-midwest.com/" rel="nofollow">military pelican cases<br></a><br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="7239913972810468121" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-46717179"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=7239913972810468121">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c7239913972810468121-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c7239913972810468121-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c7239913972810468121-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="7239913972810468121" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c7239913972810468121-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c4460305626537528872"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blank.gif" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user">Anonymous</cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1433746049113#c4460305626537528872">June 7, 2015 at 11:47 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">its
 not over... the projects names only changed is all. they still do this 
but have weened away from the drugs... their excuse is that drugs still 
must be administered close to their target and have since moved to the

 now another "name change and located elsewhere"... I dont care who 
thinks this isnt real, not my problem, but one of the main facilities 
today is still located with in the university of Kentucky and another in
 Louisville Kentucky... basically enticing psychology students and grads
 to get fast jobs to do work. but trusted ones... my mother was one of 
the psychologists from university of Kentucky and was offered to put 
others including me through "certain programs" for testing, which led to
 a severely ugly divorce between her and my father in which my father

 you for getting the word out about this POS. As the old saying goes,

 he ISN'T a pedophile.... but I doubt it. Nonetheless, there's a large 
volume of evidence to show that he was intimately involved in leading 
little children into sexually abusive situations that centered around a 
massive pedophile ring that was at least partly intended to blackmail 
politicians, business leaders, etc. in order to control them. I'm pretty
 sure that he would have been careful enough as part of all that to not 
get into a blackmail situation himself. <br><br>Perhaps he didn't sexually abuse any children that YOU know of, but that's all you can really say for him. <br><br>An accomplice is equally guilty of the crime, no matter if he was the one who 'pulled the trigger" or not. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=1109300464155949839">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c1109300464155949839-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c1109300464155949839-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c1109300464155949839-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="1109300464155949839" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c1109300464155949839-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c2817714823392196918"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/00271270605867203644" rel="nofollow">JOHN HANCOCK</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1454194145720#c2817714823392196918">January 30, 2016 at 2:49 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">This comment has been removed by the author.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin "><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=2817714823392196918">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c2817714823392196918-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c2817714823392196918-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c2817714823392196918-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="2817714823392196918" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c2817714823392196918-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c3420527441252658505"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1454194873502#c3420527441252658505">January 30, 2016 at 3:01 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Can

  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Y3tYoOt_k), you will find an 
excellent documentary on the history of CIA secret research programs on 
mind control, non-lethal weapons, and on many other interesting, though 
morally dubious subjects. Aquino is cited several times in this film.<br><br>From
 that doc, it seems that the CIA discovered long before Aquino &amp; 
Lavey got into Satanism, and long before satanic cults started to get 
popular in the 1960's, that extreme trauma, especially sexual abuse, in 
very early childhood, led to "multiple personality disorder" in many 
children. The "alter personality" was created in the child's mind to 
shield it from the horrible memories of being sexually abused. However, 
once the alter personality is so established in the young child, it 
remains there even as the child becomes an adult. <br><br>The value of 
this to the CIA relates to other of its secret research programs that 
focused on hypnosis. The CIA researchers discovered that the "main 
personality" of the adult may not even be aware of the "alter 
personality" that was established in him as a result of sexual abuse 
when he was a child. The CIA discovered that it is possible, through 
hypnosis, to "program" the alter personality without the "main 
personality" even being aware of it. So, through hypnosis, such a person
 can be programmed to commit assassinations, be a drug courier, or to be
 "programmed" to do anything else that his government employed hypnotist
 tells him to do. The beauty of this technique is that after the "alter 
personality" completes its assigned task, it submerges back into the 
subconscious and the main personality "wakes up" without any memory or 
knowledge of what the "alter personality" did. This scenario is the 
basis of the Manchurian Candidate screenplays.<br><br>So, the ORIGINAL 
purpose of Michael Aquino, a guy with military intelligence connections,
 to get into Satanism may have been to provide a pool of psychologically
 damaged children who, when they became adults, would be suitable 
candidates for "programmed" CIA missions, Manchurian Candidate type 
missions. Then, after, Aquino and other CIA types did get into Satanism,
 they may have realized that child sexual abuse was "just fun" for them 
also. It may have also led them later to discover other possible uses 
for the satanic sexual abuse, such as blackmailing prominent political 
and social leaders.<br><br>Anyway, getting back to why the CIA 
originally became interested in childhood sexual abuse, because it made 
the victims potential candidate as adults to become "programmed" robotic
 secret agents of various types, it is interesting to speculate what 
happened to the victims of Aquino and his satanic/CIA cohorts. Did any 
of them actually go out on secret CIA missions as "programmed robotic 
secret agents"? We may never know because even if they did, they 
wouldn't even know / remember that they did. Candidates for such robotic
 secret agent assignments might even be some of the very kids who 
reported being sexually abused by Aquino and his CIA cronies because as 
children and even as adults, they may not be fully aware of a possible 
"alter personality" existing within them, an "alter personality" that 
can be programmed and exploited by a government employed hypnotist who 
knows how to push the right buttons.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5076320613875195314" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-539505707"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=5076320613875195314">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c5076320613875195314-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c5076320613875195314-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div><li class="comment" id="c2910805264137117948"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1437607206256#c2910805264137117948">July 22, 2015 at 4:20 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">You
 are entirely correct about the mind-control methods that are used. 
Howver, I know that they didn't come up with the idea to use Satanism 
and sexual blackmail only when Aquino arrived on the scene. Nor was 
Satanism something 'new' to those who orchestrate these large-scale 
psyops. Trauma-based mind-control has been used in occult schools for 
millenia, and they were later adopted by the secret societies that 
evolved out of or otherwise resurrected these ancient schools. 
Superstition has been used as well by the same schools to manipulate 
people through fear. Satanism is a fear-based ideology that grew out of 
all that. IMO, Satanism is just a form of ritualized trauma centered 
around the belief that demons exist and can be invoked (as alter 
personalities) and ordered to do evil (the evil that the 'possessed' 
person does). Of course, that's just a simplified explanation that 
ignores the deeper psychic nature of the trauma state, which I won't go 
into here except to point out that the dissociated state can also induce
 amazing mental abilities like photographic memory or musical genius. 
Part of MKULTRA was to tap into these 'supernormal' abilities to create 
'uber-humans' or 'supermen'... Hitler's dream. Except it wasn't his 
dream so much as it was the dream of those who pulled his strings from 
the shadows (Hitler was a victim of trauma-based mind-control as much as
 anybody ever has been). Nazism/Satanism was planted deep within the US 
government immediately after WWII, through Operation Paperclip. When 
Aquino came along, it was already well rooted. <br><br>Chikren have been
 purposely subjected to trauma-based mind-control for much longer than 
since Aquino came along. Don't give him that credit. The major 
Luciferian power families in the world routinely subject their children 
to trauma-based mind-control in order to mold them for the lifestyle 
they will lead. It's a very old system of control. They program their 
offspring early on in order to assure that they follow traditional 
family persuits (gaining more power, increasing their wealth, holding on
 to it all, moving to a NWO, etc.)<br><br>That some of Aquino &amp; 
Co.'s child victims might actually be mind-controlled 'robot secret 
agents' is very likely. I'm quite certain that at least a few people,

 LaVey was tied to the California branch of the OTO when it was being 
run by Jack Parsons in the 50s. Jack Parsons was a rocket-fuel scientist
 who contracted out to the US government through his company, Jet 
Propulsion Labs. Their mentor, Aleister Crowley, had been a British 
intelligence agent and Nazi sympathizer. L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of 
Scientology, had also been closely associated with Parsons and the OTO 
in the 50s, prior to starting Scientology. Hubbard had been in Naval 
Intelligence. Another satanic group that became very active in Southern 
California in the late 60s – the Process Church of the Final Judgment – 
happened to be run by two high-ranking ex-Scientologists. Charles Manson
 appears to have adopted some of the Process Church philosophies, as 
well as having studied Scientology in prison. Likely offshoots of the 
Process Church that were also operating at the time (late 60s) included 
the Four Pi Movement and the Hand of Death, both of which are suspected 
of having been assassination teams for a larger satanic network that was
 run by very rich and powerful people. Serial killers David Berkowitz 
and Henry Lee Lucas both claimed to have been working for this network 
as assassins. Sirhan-Sirhan was also suspected of being tied to this 
network through the Process Church. Henry Lee Lucas happens to be the 
only person on death row in Texas to ever have his execution stayed by 
George Bush Sr. during his entire time as governor of that state. When 
you know the history of the Bush family and their very deep involvement 
in all of this, you begin to understand why such an evil tyrant like 
George would be so sympathetic to Henry. When you understand that Aquino
 was working for Bush and his crony thugs, you understand why he’s been 
so well protected as well. <br><br>“Henry claimed that what appeared to 
be the random work of a serial killer was in fact a planned series of 
crimes often committed for specific purposes. Some of the murders were 
political hits, according to Henry, including the occasional 
assassination of foreign dignitaries. This was not true for all of 
Henry's crimes. Some he did just because that's what he liked to do. And
 it was the one thing that he was really good at. The beauty of this 
arrangement was that it allowed Henry to conceal the true motive for 
many of his crimes. Those performed as contract hits looked like all of 
Henry's murders - senseless and random acts of violence.” (David 
McGowan, Programmed to Kill)<br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="2799881950156741246" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=2799881950156741246">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c2799881950156741246-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c2799881950156741246-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c2799881950156741246-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="2799881950156741246" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c2799881950156741246-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c8020022414602416676"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439250085728#c8020022414602416676">August 10, 2015 at 4:41 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Right
 about the time that Aquino was first getting involved with LaVey’s 
Church of Satan back in 1968, so were two of Charles Manson’s future 
Family members – Susan Atkins and Bobby Beausoleil. Occult filmmaker 
Kenneth Anger was cofounder of the Church of Satan with LaVey, and both 
Atkins and Beausoleil can be seen playing roles in various b-grade movie
 productions he made at about this time. Beausoleil had even lived with 
Anger for a while and was his homosexual lover. Apart from his 
low-budget satanic films, Anger was also rumored to have been involved 
in making child porn and snuff films. The same was later said about 
Hunter S. Thompson, who allegedly committed suicide immediately after 
hearing that he had been named by child-victim Paul Bonacci in relation 
to making child porn/snuff films. <br><br>So there’s evidence to show 
that before Aquino had even become a full-fledged Satanist in LaVey’s 
group, and before he even joined the military, he was already rubbing 
elbows with a couple of future mind-controlled assassins. The questions 
that arise in my mind are: 1) Was Aquino’s early interest in Satanism 
looked upon by his military recruiters as a means to an end? 2) Did 
Aquino immediately begin training as a psyop specialist because of this?

 found this comment in the article quite compelling: "Occam’s Razor 
dictates that the simplest explanation that requires the least 
assumptions to be made is usually the most accurate one, and so Aquino’s
 explanation that he’s a victim of a conspiracy lacks any plausibility 
whatsoever when compared to the alternative explanation that all these 
people are speaking honestly and are supported by a very large amount of
 evidence that explains and exposes the inner machinations of the 
criminal syndicate that Aquino has been deeply involved in throughout 
his military career." It raises a question that MUST be answered: Why 
would anyone seek to defame or discredit Aquino? What thing is he doing 
in the world that others would seek to discredit him or disable him? I 
think that when we focus on this question, the absurdity of Aquino's 
victim of conspiracy claim is obvious. He is doing NOTHING good that 
would create such animosity and effort against him. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="7786807551441648651" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-539505707"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=7786807551441648651">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c7786807551441648651-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c7786807551441648651-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c7786807551441648651-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="7786807551441648651" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c7786807551441648651-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6350364402381255175"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439585422087#c6350364402381255175">August 14, 2015 at 1:50 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Further
 to the questions I left off with in my last post… Aquino explained in 
his 1982 biography on the Church of Satan that he joined LaVey’s group 
very soon after joining the Army, although he had seen LaVey at the 
opening of Rosemary’s Baby prior to that and had been intrigued enough 
to sit in on a Friday night ceremony. Up until then, he didn’t have any 
interest in Satanism, and he seems to have been drawn into it on rather 
whimsy grounds, considering all the other alternative lifestyles and 
philosophies that were available to choose from in that part of the 
world at that particular time. He says it was LaVey’s smile, of all 
things, that convinced him to get involved. Ya, right. More like it was 
suggested to him to do so by his commanding officer. <br><br>Here’s what Aquino said about this first introduction to Satanism:<br><br>“I
 did not know it then, but I had just received my first glimpse of both a
 man and an institution who would alter my life to an extraordinary 
degree. More than that, they would alter the lives and philosophies of 
many other persons throughout the country and the world, and ultimately 
they would be responsible for a most remarkable contribution to the 
options for human social evolution.” <br><br>This was written in 1982, 
before all the controversy about Aquino’s pedophilia and mind-control 
operations. It was the same year that Aquino was involved in the 
kidnapping of Johhny Gosch. Cathy O’Brien had alleged that Aquino had 
been programming her two years earlier. Chapman and Hinckley had been 
successfully passed off as assassins in ‘80 and ‘81. It certainly is 
evident from all this that these government programmers and psyop agents
 were very busy tinkering with “options for human social evolution” at 
that time. So who were all these people Aquino was referring to whose 
lives and philosophies were altered, and who would be responsible for “a
 most remarkable contribution”? Cryptic words that offer an insight into
 what Aquino was feeling about his work at that time. The fact is, he 
couldn’t have been talking about LaVey because LaVey never really made 
any serious impression on the public in spite of all the publicity he’s 
gotten for his cheap theatrics, so Aquino was actually talking about 
something else – something that was more to do with his own career and 
the Orwellian agenda of his government employers. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="6350364402381255175" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=6350364402381255175">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c6350364402381255175-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c6350364402381255175-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c6350364402381255175-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="6350364402381255175" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c6350364402381255175-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c8145244681491781304"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439585670445#c8145244681491781304">August 14, 2015 at 1:54 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Another
 clue that Aquino was interested in Satanism for mind-control 
programming purposes is offered in this statement by him regarding 
LaVey’s decision to offer a correspondence course in Satanism to 
increase membership:<br><br>“The psychological dimension of Satanism 
depended very strongly upon personal contact, and it was not certain 
that correspondence could be comparably effective.” (M. Aquino, The 
Church of Satan, pg. 41)<br><br>You can’t really expect to program a 
person very effectively unless you have hands-on access to them. Aquino 
was obviously thinking about the effect of all LaVey’s theatrics rather 
than the teachings themselves. The theatrics had a strong psychological 
effect by increasing fear and uncertainty in the participants, which 
leads to the dissociative state that is so vital to mind-control 
programming. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="8145244681491781304" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=8145244681491781304">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c8145244681491781304-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c8145244681491781304-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c8145244681491781304-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="8145244681491781304" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c8145244681491781304-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c3029738616120011790"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439586453551#c3029738616120011790">August 14, 2015 at 2:07 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Another small clue comes further on, where Aquino quotes a letter from LaVey in which he says (emphasis in original):<br><br>“I
 was highly intrigued by your description of PSYOP and noted with 
particular pleasure that you referred to “weaknesses of the mind”, which
 of course evokes much Satanic rumination on my part.” (M. Aquino, The 
Church of Satan, pg. 48)<br><br>Aquino had been talking about Satanism 
in terms of people’s psychological weaknesses. As LaVey indicates, 
Aquino had been thinking about Satanism in terms of its use in psyops, 
not as a philosophy. <br><br>I have a feeling that Aquino joined the 
Church of Satan under the pretext of being interested in the teachings, 
but was really being directed into it by higher-ups within the military 
and developing the same sort of theatrical persona as LaVey in order to 
later entice those who proved themselves to be serious followers and 
those who were the biggest dupes into his own little cult, where he 
would have full hands-on access to them to mold them for his employer’s 
purposes. <br><br>I also believe that LaVey was being unwittingly used 
to promote the idea that Satanism was alive and well in America, with 
the expectation that he and his church would take the blame for the 
systematic terror that was about to be unleashed on the public in the 
days, months, and years ahead. The following words in a letter from 
LaVey to Aquino might have actually set off the idea to use him this 
way. This quote came just days before Charles Manson and his gang were 
arrested for their murders, and may have prompted Aquino and his 
handlers to use LaVey and his church in this way:<br><br>“[I]f they need a villain to fulfill their masochistic psychological needs, then I’m glad to oblige!” <br><br>Immediately
 after the announcement that Manson had been caught, LaVey had concerns 
about bad publicity for himself and his church. I guess he spoke to soon
 about wanting to be the villain. <br><br>Here’s Aquino’s thoughts on this:<br><br>“While
 Anton LaVey conceptualized the Church and its philosophy as something 
positive and constructive, unchained to old definitions and stereotypes,
 many of those who sought out the institution did not draw that 
distinction. For them Satanism was the Satanism of La-Bas or Dennis 
Wheatley novels – a glorification of negative, destructive values. They 
saw in Anton LaVey what they wanted to see in him – a god-figure who 
would not only forgive “Helter Skelter” but encourage it.”<br><br>Did 
Aquino or his employers foresee this? Aquino questioned the merits of 
offering a correspondence course in Satanism, which, along with the 
publication of the Satanic Bible, led to an outbreak of satanic crimes 
across the US. Aquino had thought that much would be lost in the effect 
of the teachings without hands-on access to the students. Apparently, 
LeVay didn’t make it very clear that he was only about ‘positive’ 
Satanism, whatever that is, and Aquino didn’t do anything to try to 
change that understanding, in spite of his pretensions. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="3029738616120011790" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=3029738616120011790">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c3029738616120011790-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c3029738616120011790-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c3029738616120011790-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="3029738616120011790" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c3029738616120011790-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c3236898367691690725"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439586685881#c3236898367691690725">August 14, 2015 at 2:11 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">In
 the same letter from LaVey that I quoted from in the previous post, 
which was written very soon after the Manson murders, he makes a rather 
cryptic allusion to people choosing between ‘freedom or bondage’:<br><br>“It
 somewhat saddens me to realize that even when you offer the masses 
something better and a choice between freedom and bondage with regard to
 religion or even just a way of life, most will choose bondage.”<br><br>I
 already pointed out that two of the murderers were previously connected
 to the Church of Satan. I now want to point out that it had never been 
properly explained why a white rope had been symbolically wrapped around
 the necks of several of the victims. Did it signify their choice of 
bondage? Sharon Tate and some others in her circle had been involved in 
Satanism, so it seems that the rope may have been a message to the rest 
of them. There’s so much that I could get into here about the Manson 
connection, but I want to keep these posts focused on Aquino. The Manson
 connection has an incredible number of ties to military/intelligence 
circles. So does the entire 60s youth movement that ushered in the 
satanic Aquarian New Age we’re now living in today. It’s all so very 
connected, from the top down…. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="3236898367691690725" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=3236898367691690725">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c3236898367691690725-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c3236898367691690725-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c3236898367691690725-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="3236898367691690725" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c3236898367691690725-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c1063974479328160662"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439586827792#c1063974479328160662">August 14, 2015 at 2:13 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Aquino

 to his book (pgs. 50 – 51, 70 – 71), during Aquino’s stint in Vietnam 
shortly after joining the Church of Satan in 1969, he was supposedly 
busy writing up new doctrines for LaVey’s church while under heavy 
combat, dodging grenades and rockets and whatnot. Sure he was. It seems 
more likely to me that he was passing on material that was being crafted
 as part of a developing government psyop, since that’s what psyops are 
generally involved with – creating and disseminating information that 
will be attractive to their target audiences and lead them to think and 
act in ways that ultimately serves its creators. <br><br>Whatever the 
case, up to that point LaVey had been using rather amateurishly 
presented and mostly plagiarized material and his church didn’t have any
 real focus other than to discuss occult mysteries. According to his 
book, it seems that Aquino was intent early on in bolstering LaVey’s 
church with the sort of doctrinal substance that would really sell the 
charade to its members and make the church appear more on a parallel 
with the OTO and Golden Dawn. This would also effectively put Aquino – 
and his handlers – in control of the cult members, since if you can 
control what someone believes, you can control that person. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5130936345940665761" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=5130936345940665761">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c5130936345940665761-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c5130936345940665761-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c5130936345940665761-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5130936345940665761" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c5130936345940665761-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c5401827921267402287"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439846004046#c5401827921267402287">August 17, 2015 at 2:13 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Like
 most of the larger publishing houses, Avon Books has been controlled by
 the CIA for a very long time. For anyone who has never published 
anything of any significance before, it’s unusual for such a large 
publishing house to ask them to write a book, particularly where the 
author is given free license to put whatever he wants into it. They’re 
usually only interested in proven talent and works that are guaranteed 
to sell. It’s suspicious then that LaVey had been approached by them 
(and not the other way around) to write the Satanic Bible. The book – 
which turned out to be nothing more than a hodge-podge of mostly 
plagiarized material – helped immensely in promoting the idea that 
Satanism (and the Church of Satan) was alive and well in America, and 
reached a much larger audience than LaVey could ever have been able to 
otherwise. The excuse given by Avon Books (according to Aquino’s book) 
was that Rosemary’s Baby had been so successful and had created a new 
interest in the occult. Ya, sure. It’s more likely that Rosemary’s Baby 
was just another staged part of this mass introduction to the Aquarian 
New Age, as were the Manson murders and so much more. The book inspired 
many of its readers to begin their own personal explorations into 
Satanism, and I suspect that was the plan. <br><br>By 1972 the Church of
 Satan was getting a lot of free national publicity, and this could only
 have been by the purposeful design of those who control the media. 
Although the publicity wasn’t exactly ‘good’ publicity, it served its 
purpose. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5401827921267402287" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=5401827921267402287">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c5401827921267402287-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c5401827921267402287-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c5401827921267402287-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5401827921267402287" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c5401827921267402287-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c4091087980885114980"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439846155060#c4091087980885114980">August 17, 2015 at 2:15 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">According
 to Aquino (pg. 59), the Church of Satan was attracting a LOT of people 
whose interest was more about sex than it was about the occult. I’m sure
 that Aquino and his handlers took special note of that. He actually 
outlines the reasoning why such a cult would naturally attract perverts 
and how it would result in them becoming frustrated and unfulfilled (pg.
 61):<br><br>“It was something of a Satanic Catch-22:the Church of Satan
 would deny the stigma of perversion, thereby seeming a haven for 
“perverse” persons. These same persons, however, would quickly become 
frustrated unless their preferences were catered to, either ritually or 
socially, as perversions.” <br><br>In other words, satanic cults tended 
to draw in perverts, and Aquino recognized that their perversions could 
never really be satisfied if they were indulged in with other willing 
parties. Just as a rapist could never be satisfied with a willing 
victim, neither will many other perversions (i.e. sadomasochism, 
pedophilia, necrophilia. etc.) be truly satisfied unless they’re played 
out for real. I’m sure that the promotion of Satanism throughout the 70s
 (helped immensely by the publication of the Satanic Bible), and the 
unfulfilled perversions of many of those who were attracted to it, had a
 lot to do with the sudden outbreak of satanically oriented crimes that 
started taking place. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="4091087980885114980" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=4091087980885114980">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c4091087980885114980-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c4091087980885114980-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c4091087980885114980-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="4091087980885114980" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c4091087980885114980-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c5922366837291791074"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1439846333757#c5922366837291791074">August 17, 2015 at 2:18 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">As
 early September of 1971, LaVey had a special project he was working on 
that had to do with creating “human-featured robots or androids”. 
According to his wife, Diane (pg. 145):<br><br>“He has some “tricks” in 
his bag that could well create an entirely new industry as well as 
influence mankind as nothing has since the first means of long-distance,
 mass communication or air travel. It’s not some esoteric, 
head-in-the-clouds magical theory either, and I’m not exaggerating as to
 the “change in accordance with his will” which it would accomplish. […]
 It encompasses the mental, physical, spiritual, emotional – all of 
which are manipulated […] via a material object and a complex program 
which must accompany this device.” <br><br>Aquino elaborated on this further:<br><br>“Anton’s
 androids, however, would be specifically designed to respond and appeal
 to the intellectual, emotional, and sexual fetishes of their owners. 
One might describe them as the ultimate elaboration of the “blow-up 
dolls” which may be found in “marital aids”-type hard core pornography 
stores. But what Anton had in mind was not just a sex toy, but an 
artificial, “ideal” companion for each individual who ordered one.”<br><br>Sounds a lot like the Monarch sex slaves, doesn’t it? <br><br>Some members were also experimenting with hypnosis.

whims. They require no energy-consuming interaction in order to salve a 
non-existent ego. Yet even the semblance of an ego can be built into an 
android via actions and words – but always according to the Maker’s 
requirements. They can be shelved when they grow tiresome, brought back 
out when needed, modified in appearance, and destroyed without moral 
conscience.”<br><br>“They are ideal companions. They never talk back, 
unless you want them to, yet you can insult them to your heart’s 
content. Insofar as work is concerned, that can be performed by either 
non-humanoid machines or humans of limited intelligence operating 
machines of greater intelligence.”<br><br>“Androids offer splendid 
companionship when cast in the physical semblance of human beings. And 
for all most people have to say, they might as well say nothing. 
Essentially they are merely decorations in a room – humanoids to 
alleviate what might be construed as loneliness.”<br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="8145058159346302058" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=8145058159346302058">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c8145058159346302058-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c8145058159346302058-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c8145058159346302058-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="8145058159346302058" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c8145058159346302058-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c3169340908809831420"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1440444400268#c3169340908809831420">August 24, 2015 at 12:26 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">On page 117 of Aquino’s book it mentions a “Master Plan” behind the Church of Satan.

value can then be extracted, and the Temples and Pleasure Domes can be

he mentions “the movement”, so obviously the intent was to start a 
satanic movement in the USA, and they wanted to fill their ranks with 
people who would be useful to that end. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="3169340908809831420" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=3169340908809831420">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c3169340908809831420-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c3169340908809831420-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div><li class="comment" id="c1847440124916263503"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1441145695042#c1847440124916263503">September 1, 2015 at 3:14 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Re LaVey’s ‘Pleasure Domes’ (pg. 439):<br><br>“One
 of the main goals of the Church of Satan is to build pleasure domes in 
which the members of the Church can indulge themselves in their personal
 desires. By having a place to go where they can release their desires, 
the members can lead an unfrustrated life in the everyday world. […] A 
pleasure dome would consist of many different rooms and recreational 
facilities for the purpose of fulfilling each member’s personal 
desires.” <br><br>This sounds a lot like Bohemian Grove. <br><br>It 
dawns on me that if one is to expect their desires to be fulfilled 
(sexual or otherwise), then there would have to be others available to 
fulfill them. Who did LaVey have in mind? Did he just expect members to 
be ready and willing to fulfill each other’s perverted fantasies? 
Whatever happened to this idea of LaVey’s? Aquino never comments on it 
at all, and it’s only mentioned within LaVey’s quoted correspondences 
and other reproduced material. <br><br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=1847440124916263503">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c1847440124916263503-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c1847440124916263503-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c1847440124916263503-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="1847440124916263503" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c1847440124916263503-ce"></div></li></div><div id="c3169340908809831420-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="3169340908809831420" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c3169340908809831420-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c7341293388755576302"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1440444552965#c7341293388755576302">August 24, 2015 at 12:29 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">The

 he wasn’t actually running the show, almost from the moment that he 
joined, Aquino was helping to guide the Church of Satan in certain 
directions with his helpful input. By the end of 1971 he was the only 
one besides the LaVey’s to be “entrusted with the knowledge, 
prerogatives, and power” of the church (pg. 144). LaVey’s church would 
have served Aquino as the perfect front to scout for prospective dupes 
and patsies who might be of use in secret government programs or 
operations. When Aquino left in 1975 to start his Temple of Set, he was 
thus in a position to take with him those members who were most suitable
 for whatever plans he had in mind. This was at a point when Lavey and 
his church were already quite recognized and would have been suspected 
as the likeliest source for all the satanically influenced crimes that 
were to occur more and more often over ensuing years, while the Temple 
of Set remained far more unassuming. <br><br>Aquino mentions in his book
 (pg. 50) that the Church of Satan drew in many “psychotics, criminals, 
and destructive deviants”, so he knew full well that satanic cults would
 provide a good source of patsies and dupes who could be used and abused
 in whatever way and then tossed aside like so much garbage without 
worrying about their credibility should they ever fall into trouble. <br><br>As
 it was, from its start and for many years the Church of Satan never 
bothered to define what it meant by Satanism, so a lot of people who 
joined just assumed it meant whatever they thought it did, which wasn’t 
really their fault. Because of this failure to properly understand what 
LaVey’s version of Satanism was supposed to be, there were a lot of 
members who adopted the widest definition and acted on it. The Satanic 
Bible didn’t exactly help with its clear references to human and animal 
sacrifice, etc., which was essentially seen as condoning these things. <br><br>Eventually,
 many of those who joined and were allowed to start their own grottoes 
were kicked out when their activities started raising concerns, but this
 expulsion just led them to start their own satanic cults where they 
continued as before. So a rash of new, more ‘satanic’ satanic cults were
 developing by the early 1970s because of the Church of Satan. <br><br>And
 throughout Aquino’s book – even with his knowledge and skills in 
psychological operations – he feigns that this was all an unexpected 
eventuality. Sure it was. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="1011992208557743106" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=1011992208557743106">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c1011992208557743106-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c1011992208557743106-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c1011992208557743106-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="1011992208557743106" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c1011992208557743106-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c1727562389374937696"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1440444898987#c1727562389374937696">August 24, 2015 at 12:34 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">By
 1972, once they had successfully commercialized Satanism, LaVey and 
Aquino began focusing on drawing in people with stature as members of 
the Church of Satan while only offering newsletter subscriptions to 
anyone who didn’t fit the bill. Most of the people who had been 
initiated into the ranks up to this point were proving to be a handful. 
It was expected that these ‘high-stature’ members would be willing to 
make public their affiliation to the church, apparently in order to 
temper the public to the idea that people they were already familiar 
with and trusted were Satanists. There was a problem, however, in that 
most of the more serious members who had any stature were afraid to 
publicly admit that they were Satanists. <br><br>That would mean that most Satanists out there who have any stature are going to be closet Satanists who put on a false front. <br><br>Aquino explains (pg. 303):<br><br>“Each
 candidate for the priesthood is also asked to sponsor a minimum of ten 
new members of the Church. There are two primary reasons for this. 
First, it serves to separate the Black Magician from the armchair 
intellectual. Satanic Priests and Priestesses must be active in their 
own right; they cannot merely be competent critics of others. Second, 
the sort of persons you sponsor will indicate much concerning the social
 circles in which you move and the influence you have with them. All 
these factors are considered in evaluating your suitability for the 
Priesthood and the ways in which your magical expertise might best be 
applied in the future.”<br><br>A new condition for membership was described by Aquino (pg. 307):<br><br>“Consequently
 we are instituting some very radical alterations in both the newsletter
 and the approach to membership. Rather than attempting to inspire 
persons to apply for membership, we are going to tighten our standards 
even more. The end result will be that we will select those whose 
behavioral patterns bear the mark of the Devil, and we will inform them 
that they have been approved for membership in the Church of Satan.”<br><br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="1727562389374937696" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=1727562389374937696">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c1727562389374937696-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c1727562389374937696-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c1727562389374937696-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="1727562389374937696" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c1727562389374937696-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c1678710879801046744"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1440445293523#c1678710879801046744">August 24, 2015 at 12:41 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">They

 clue as to LaVey’s ideas about creating ‘robots’ is quoted by Aquino 
where LaVey alludes to the movie Westworld as a “grim but prophetic 
glimpse of future Satanic projects.” (pg. 316) As Aquino explained it:<br><br>“Westworld
 was a newly-released horror/science-fiction film featuring androids 
designed for human entertainment, and thus dovetailed nicely into 
Anton’s plans for an actual enterprise along this line.”<br><br>Even 
though Aquino accredits this macabre idea to LaVey, I see no reason to 
think that Aquino didn’t harbor the same idea himself, and attempted to 
carry it out later on when he was involved in programming children to be
 sex objects. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="213835139208597993" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=213835139208597993">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c213835139208597993-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c213835139208597993-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c213835139208597993-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="213835139208597993" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c213835139208597993-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c27327466651046053"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1441052536607#c27327466651046053">August 31, 2015 at 1:22 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Even
 back in the 70s, Aquino was well aware that organized Satanists were 
behind all the great wars and revolutions, and that Communism was as 
much part of their plan as was the creation of the United States of 
America (actually founded as a Masonic corporation). He names Franklin, 
Madison, Paine, Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton as witting parties to the
 global Satanic agenda. (pg. 338) <br><br>He went on to state: <br><br>“Brilliance
 cannot be institutionalized. Men who seek to perpetuate their 
accomplishments by establishing governments to ape them are guilty of 
folly. Only a concept that is intrinsically greater than humans can 
survive. To do so it will undergo continual semantic metamorphosis, 
because it will surface in different cultures at different points of 
time. The key to the political strength of Satanism is that it is the 
most powerful of all trans-human concepts. Those who realize this and 
act upon it are virtually invulnerable.”<br><br>This reflects his 
understanding of who really has the power in this world, and how they 
use the same concepts wrapped up in different labels and definitions to 
lead large masses of people to do evil under the guise of doing 
something good. Aquino knows that Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, etc. were
 all just puppets of elitist Satanists who pulled their strings. Let’s 
not forget as well that Aquino serves the Bush family, who earned their 
way into the satanic elite when old Prescott committed treason helping 
to finance Hitler. The Bush’s have remained invulnerable and steadily 
grown in power only because they serve an ideal that’s greater than what
 they could ever become on their own. All of these elitists at the top 
of the hierarchy are the same. The god that’s worshipped within the 
highest degrees of Freemasonry (and a number of other major secret 
societies) is Baphomet, the same god that Satanists worship. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="27327466651046053" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=27327466651046053">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c27327466651046053-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c27327466651046053-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c27327466651046053-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="27327466651046053" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c27327466651046053-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c842670348515882570"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1441052581238#c842670348515882570">August 31, 2015 at 1:23 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">In 1974, Aquino was expecting some sort of “new Pearl Harbor”.

 is a passage in Aquino's book (pg. 351) that reveals that he was under 
some degree of hypnotic influence during his years with the Church of 
Satan. He describes having experiences of ‘automatic writing’. Unless he
 was making it up and using this as an excuse for where he got the 
material, he claims to have produced a number of satanic works in this 
way. <br><br>Another clue is found in his book where he describes doing a
 ritual, and the results are what sounds like trance-induced imagery 
that he took to be a real clairvoyant experience (pg. 404):<br><br>“Then
 the result: I recall coming, under hazy circumstances, to a large 
wooden-beamed hall in which were seated a number of men around a table. I
 knew them to be the “Secret Chiefs” of the “White” tradition of whom 
Aleister Crowley and others have spoken.”<br><br>It goes on a little 
further, but the whole thing can be taken as nothing more than imagery 
created by Aquino’s own imagination, since he gained nothing from the 
experience that would clarify that it was anything more than that. 
Anyone familiar with the teachings of the Theosophists and Rosicrucians 
will recognize the reference to “Secret Chiefs”. These entities are 
supposedly in communication with the upper echelons of these secret 
groups and direct them through channeled communications. They supposedly
 only communicate with those who are advanced enough to reach them. This
 suggests to me that Aquino was merely trying to make it appear that he 
was developing such a link with these entities, which would surely 
elevate him in the eyes of other Satanists. <br><br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="4290275836561234114" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=4290275836561234114">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c4290275836561234114-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c4290275836561234114-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div><li class="comment" id="c5085595179602490058"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1441052987885#c5085595179602490058">August 31, 2015 at 1:29 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Aquino
 describes the 306th Psychological Operations Battalion where he was 
stationed at Fort MacArthur, in San Pedro, California, in 1974: <br><br>“[T]he
 306th seemed to attract every mad scientist, character actor, and 
miscellaneous weirdo in the Los Angeles area. One group of officers, 
dearly beloved by the battalion, decked out their office on the post as a
 medieval chamber, complete with candelabra, wine-bottles, sumptuous 
rugs, and antique oak furniture. They were served wine by nude wenches, 
whose photographs appeared charmingly on the walls. Often these 
gallants, who had forsaken ordinary U.S. Army uniforms for 
custom-designed ones of Ruritarian splendor, would conduct impromptu 
duels with fencing sabres. It was not uncommon for the battalion staff 
to be holding a briefing for the commander (a World War II command 
bomber pilot) while the clash of steel was heard through the window.”<br><br>“Then
 there was a reserved but cheerful lieutenant who all but disappeared 
behind an oversized field jacket and aviator’s mustache – Bruce Bibee. 
His hobby was bombs, explosives, and implements of destruction in

disposal on his chest. He would later become an Adept II of the Temple 
of Set.”<br><br>“The unit’s intelligence officer was indeed a towering 
presence; his name was Dennis Mann and he stood almost seven feet tall. 
To confuse people he drove the smallest Fiat made, whose license plate 
read, “GONZO-1” in honor of his hero, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson 
(caricatured as “Uncle Duke” in Garry Trudeau’s Doonesbury comic strip).
 Dennis went on to become a Master of the Temple IV and a member of the 
Temple of Set’s Council of Nine.”<br><br>“All of which is to say that I 
felt right at home in the 306th PSYOP Battalion, and it felt equally 
happy to have someone on the staff to personify its spiritual climate…”

 Church of Satan (and probably the Temple of Set) had “a standing policy

 to Aquino’s book, he left the Church of Satan in 1975 after LaVey 
suddenly and inexplicably changed the way the church was being run and 
decided to sell the higher degrees to members rather than expect them to
 earn their advancement within his church. Before Aquino left, however, 
he sent out a bulletin to Church of Satan members announcing the 
founding of his own church, claiming that it had been sanctioned by no 
less than Satan himself. (pgs. 407-12) This was a death-knell for the 
Church of Satan, leading to its quick disintegration. Many or most in 
its upper ranks likely shifted directly into similar positions within 
the new Temple of Set, including LaVey’s daughter, Zeena. LaVey was 
forever hateful of Aquino after this, while Aquino claims that he 
continued to regard LaVey very highly, but his devotion to Satan had 
been more important so he had to do it. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5822287182848968260" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=5822287182848968260">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c5822287182848968260-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c5822287182848968260-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c5822287182848968260-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="5822287182848968260" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c5822287182848968260-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c2178034081833456987"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1441145598602#c2178034081833456987">September 1, 2015 at 3:13 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Fighting
 and general distain between higher-ranking members of the Church of 
Satan is highlighted throughout Aquino’s book, revealing the shallow 
mentality of the group as a whole. It becomes obvious after reading it 
that Aquino supplied much of the impetus to carry the church as far as 
it got, with LaVey acting more as its public figurehead and little else.
 At least that’s how it comes across in the book. But as a psyop 
specialist, Aquino is a manipulator of facts, so the book probably 
served its author as more than just a biography of the Church of Satan. 
At the very least, he drags LaVey through the mud and only honors his 
own past dedication to the church, rather than the man who supposedly 
made it what it was. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="2178034081833456987" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=2178034081833456987">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c2178034081833456987-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c2178034081833456987-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c2178034081833456987-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="2178034081833456987" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c2178034081833456987-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c8889171840179831882"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1441145749264#c8889171840179831882">September 1, 2015 at 3:15 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">A few key elements in LaVey’s explanation of what a satanic ritual is (pg. 440):<br><br>“Ritual
 magic is a very real power. It utilizes such tools as hypnosis, 
telepathy, psychology, etc. […] A Satanic ritual is basically an 
emotional rather than an intellectual performance. For this reason 
certain devices and dramatic effects are used.”<br><br>This describes 
the basic elements involved in traditional methods of mind-control,

 can an EEG mapping anyone's psyche? EEGs are measuring brainwaves and 
not your thoughts. What medication did you got at the facility? I don't 
mean this in a offensive way. I know that people get there for the wrong
 reasons. And certain meds can cause wrong beliefs about EEG or other 
devices. In no way I am doubting you got abused there.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-996094702"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=6004435685514681446">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c6004435685514681446-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c6004435685514681446-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c6004435685514681446-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="6004435685514681446" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c6004435685514681446-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6800203407686055788"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1454195797452#c6800203407686055788">January 30, 2016 at 3:16 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">See
 my article A Primer on V2K vs. Mind-Reading Technologies on another 
blog page. You will see that I don't agree with what the commenter above
 wrote. I can't and won't answer for them. Many people who have been 
through extremely abusive situations begin to hear voices for whatever 
reason. This is seen in case after case. I believe that it's an effect 
of trauma-based MPD/DID, in which the various personalities are leaking 
through. Aquino and company know all about creating MPD in victims in 
order to control them. There's a whole science that the military has 
developed to do this. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=6800203407686055788">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c6800203407686055788-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c6800203407686055788-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c6800203407686055788-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="6800203407686055788" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c6800203407686055788-ce"></div></li></div><div id="c707168091916741039-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="707168091916741039" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c707168091916741039-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6170230702932012653"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/02884101733306064566" rel="nofollow">Unknown</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1449541977166#c6170230702932012653">December 7, 2015 at 6:32 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">No he's not </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="6170230702932012653" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-976530180"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=6170230702932012653">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c6170230702932012653-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c6170230702932012653-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div><li class="comment" id="c2106154766248725460"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1449800777724#c2106154766248725460">December 10, 2015 at 6:26 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Really?

 don't defend this guy. But can understand that it appears that way. If

 posted that comment because I haven't collected all data on this case

 part of the inner aspects of this syndicate, appears to be a 
"biological warfare" testing unti.  Meaning that they are designing 
viruses that remain dormant in the immune system, but can be activated 
at a later time.  Which leads to the heavier known diseases (ebola, 
small pox, measles, anthrax, etc) can be placed into the body which 
usually fights off these infections naturally although they remain 
dormant.  Attaching these viruses to several other types of "flu" or 
"colds", and so fourth in a sequence of code, could activate these 
sicknesses.<br><br>I only speak of this because I have had experience 
with intentional virus spreading (common cold and Swine flu) amongst 
larger groups of unsuspecting, Christian people.  This all happened

 If you refuse to correct your lies by consulting the documentary 
sources I provided, that also speaks to your lack of ethics and resolve

 me with your legal contact information and I'll have my attorneys do 
that asset search. Civil suits are time-consuming and expensive, so are 
only practical if the offender has an adequate net worth.<br><br>As you 
will see from the source documents I cited to you, this is why the 
"child sex allegation" scams, such as that attempted by Chaplain Larry 
Adams-Thompson against my wife and myself at the Presidio, became such a
 runaway national fad. Parents and quack-therapists quickly learned that
 they could hide behind coached children in multi-million-$ 
claims/suits. This eventually wore itself out when not a single such 
"Satanic cult" fantasy was substantiated. Unfortunately for such 
parents, by the 1990s their children had learned that they had a much 
better chance of accusing them and other close relatives, so that's 
where the fad shifted. Not as much fun anymore, obviously. [And of 
course to institutions with actual close family ties, such as the 
Catholic Church.]﻿<br>Show less<br><br>Michael Aquino28 Apr 2016<br><br><br> <br> <br>+Anthony

 Forwood I'm perfectly content for readers of my The Church of Satan to 
decide for themselves whether it is fair, comprehensive, and objective. 
Judging by all of the feedback I've received since it first appeared ca.
 1981, you're pretty much alone in your denunciation. And apparently 
you've not read it, otherwise you wouldn't make the mistake of saying 
that it contains none of my own correspondence or writings; there are

 Forwood Mr. Forwood, it's long and overwhelmingly been established that
 my wife and I were simply the innocent targets of the Army chaplain's 
1987 "SRA" scam, and that all of the copycat allegations following that 
media circus were just that: completely unfounded invention. Only a few 
child-sex-fetishists still try to recycle that old mud, either for their
 own desperate self-advertisement or because it's a sex-fantasy of their
 own. If these are the labels you want to claim for yourself, you're the
 one who will have to live with your image, not me.<br><br>Your response
 here rather glaringly made it clear that you have no other axe to grind
 except these two personal motives. Over the years I have been targeted 
by, for example, conventional religious fanatics [with invariably 
mistaken cartoon-ideas of my religion]. Had you turned out to be one of 
those, I could have, as with them, constructively corrected your 
cartoons. <br><br>And there have been the conspiracy-freaks who go 
ballistic when they see the term "PSYOP", for whom a different 
curriculum of factual education may be therapeutic. Or not; some are 
over-the-top saliva-droolers.<br><br>I will accordingly leave you with 
this very simple point: Throughout my entire U.S. Army career I held an 
above-Top Secret security clearance, e.g. at the Compartmented level. As
 you can easily independently verify, these clearances (TS/SCI) require 
the most exhaustive and continuously monitored SBI (Special Background 
Investigations) by the U.S. Defense Investigative Service. Anyone under 
DIS' eye is a completely open book: If there's anything the least 
questionable about your conduct, ethics, or honesty, you simply don't 
get the TS/SCI clearance, and that's that. There's no appeal, no 
overruling possible.<br><br>So even if I were such a genius as to 
deceive the San Francisco Police Department, the FBI, the Army Criminal 
Investigation Command, and all of my own senior commanders - none of 
which charged me with any crime anytime or even entered so much as a 
letter of reprimand in my personnel file, if DIS found the slightest 
thing to question - whether or not it was legally chargeable - no TS/SCI
 and in my career specialty that would have ended my commission right 
there. The record shows that I held TS/SCI right up until my 
personally-requested 1994 active retirement. [I had just completed a 
TS/SCI assignment as an Intelligence Officer for HQ US Space Command.] 
Whereupon the Secretary of the Army awarded me the Meritorious Service 
Medal covering the entire previous decade [including the time of the 
chaplain's scam]. See the MSM citation for yourself:<br><br>http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/PSFSummary.pdf<br><br>If

 for the sort of operation that you were involved in. I never said that 
the US military wasn't involved in this as well. In fact, I inferred 
that it WAS and still IS. I know how compartmentalization works, and how
 an 'open book' is only really open to certain pages for certain people 
depending on certain things. So much can still be kept very secret. I 
also know about using 'initiation rites', entrapment, and blackmail to 
keep people silent and closely bonded as a group to a particular cause, 
as you should be QUITE familiar with as well. I also know that your US 
military and intelligence agencies routinely engages in (criminal) 
domestic operations that go far beyond what the public realizes, 
including setting up, running, training, and supplying groups like 
militias and cults, etc., in order to use them as resources for their 
little domestic psyops. <br><br>YOU were the IDEAL candidate for a major
 secret agenda to introduce the apparent realism of Satanism into 
American culture, whether it really existed or not. The point was to 
raise FEAR and to create CONFUSION, in order to split the public into 
two groups who were diametrically iopposite in their beliefs about that.
 THEN you dropped the 'conspiracy' ball (at that time it was termed by 
your friends in the influential media as the 'Satanic Scare'). claiming 
that it was all just imaginary fears created because YOU went on 
national TV more than once all dressed up like Uncle Fester from the 
Addam's Family and looking so fucking ridiculous that nobody in their

 Aquino, as for the "documented sources" you referred me to, they are 
just your own silly writings! That's ALL you really have to back 
yourself up, isn't it? That's all you've ever had. This just highlights 
the fact that not even ONE friend or fellow Satanist has ever come to 
your defense, in all these years! Why is that, for such a popular guy 
like you with all your supposed credibility and honor as a decorated 
career officer in the god-damned US Army, and for all your 
self-proclaimed morals and ethics as an admittedly self-serving 
Satanist? Huh???<br><br>Let's put things into perspective here, you old 
prune. Just look on the internet or anywhere else where anyone has had a
 good thing to say about you, or try to find mention of even ONE good 
deed you've ever done that deserves any respect. Serving in the military
 at the level you did equates to consciously taking part in killing 
innocent humans on a mass scale for reasons that aren't moral or ethical
 and only serve your masters. I could give a shit how you might paint 
yourself. I know that you cut your teeth helping to run the death squads
 in Vietnam, even if from a relatively safe distance. It wasn't all just
 a dream, you know. Let's not make any bones about it, Mikey, YOU are a 
genocidal murderer and have spent your whole life working for other 
genocidal murderers for causes that don't serve to make the world better
 for the majority of us. Given how you've chosen to live your life, you 
have obviously acquired a VERY slanted view of the world, and your 
Satanic philosophies slant it even further from the rest of us ordinary 
folk who have to live in the fucked up world you helped to create. You 
are a psychopath and you can't see that, but you DO show the traits. And
 NONE of this has anything to do with your involvement in running 
pedophile rings for the elite. That obviously came later, AFTER you were
 heavily immersed in and took part in the worst evils that went on in 
Vietnam. Did you ever eat human flesh, Mikey? How did they blackmail you
 when you were still so young? I do wonder about what caused you to take
 up Satanism in the first place. i don'yt buy that story you gave us in 
your book... an idle interst. ya right. Right when you would have been 
assigned your first domestic operation as a fully trained psyop 
specialist. During a time when we now know from all the evidence that 
many psyop groups were active in your part of town at that very time.

 mother was a child prodigy who was enrolled at Stanford University at 
the age of 14, being one of the youngest students to ever attend there. 
(Stanford was an MKULTRA programming site for many years.) She went to 
Germany in the 1930s to study sculpting under a Nazi teacher. She 
eventually entered into aristocratic society as an adult. Apparently, 
she was also a High Priestess in her son's Temple of Set after it came 
into being. She had also apparently been leasing the house that her son 
now lives in to an organization that was involved in protecting children
 from child abuse. That would have been a good way to make her appear to
 be someone who cared about children while using the organization to 
acquire children for early experiments in trauma-based mind-control. 
Just a thought.... <br> <br>Aquino's father was a Sergeant in Patton's 
3rd Army division. What a strange match! There's not much information 
about him that I can find, probably because it would reveal something. <br><br>As
 for Aquino's mother, child prodigies often (or always?) arise from 
having lived through very traumatic experiences very early in life. This
 has been one of the main goals of MKULTRA -- to create people with 
exceptional abilities who can be placed in positions where they will 
serve their masters in their dark long-term agendas. Satanism is the 
perfect vehicle for creating such extreme trauma in people. Many 
aristocratic families have long-standing generational ties to occult 
groups whose members practice using trauma on their own children to 
mould them for future use by the group. <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="6195598485757941332" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=6195598485757941332">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c6195598485757941332-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c6195598485757941332-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c6195598485757941332-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="6195598485757941332" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c6195598485757941332-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c7998226019667290298"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1474142588790#c7998226019667290298">September 17, 2016 at 1:03 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">I
 just stumbled on the following lengthy article, which gives very 
explicit details about the elite's international pedophile ring and 
names people in very high places who are or have been involved in the 
Marc Dutroux case in Belgium. It also details some of the ties to 
Michael Aquino, although these will undoubtedly be limited, since this 
is primarily related to what was uncovered in Belgium in more recent 
times than when Aquino was actively operating. But the connection is 
there. I warn readers that this material is extremely descriptive and 
not for weak stomaches.... <br><br>http://www.illuminati-news.com/0/snuff2.htm</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="7998226019667290298" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=7998226019667290298">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c7998226019667290298-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c7998226019667290298-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c7998226019667290298-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="7998226019667290298" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c7998226019667290298-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c699414090410958990"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1474271306034#c699414090410958990">September 19, 2016 at 12:48 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">This link is well worth reading:<br><br>https://infrakshun.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/satans-little-helpers-viii-weimar-magick-and-cherry-marines/<br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="699414090410958990" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1157669518"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=699414090410958990">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c699414090410958990-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c699414090410958990-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c699414090410958990-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="699414090410958990" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c699414090410958990-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c18823605050814853"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/15586654359814176758" rel="nofollow">Anthony Forwood</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1474492553943#c18823605050814853">September 21, 2016 at 2:15 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">This quote from Peter Lavenda's very interesting Sinister Forces is worth noting:<br><br>"To
 the outside world, these people are all “Process” or “Church of Satan”

with these organizations before they began their criminal activity. What
 the occult Orders have done, however, deliberately or not, is provide 
these individuals—often more dedicated, more serious, even more 
charismatic than their own leaders—with the philosophical basis for 
their actions; in many cases, providing them with the ritual tools,

 article and great observations by the panel. Interestingly, most people
 remain unaware that over 3,000 children are yearly missing in LA, CA as
 a direct result of Cult related abductions for human sacrifices, 
combined with the on-going demand for sex-trade and human trafficking. 
Unfortunately, the mainstream news media refuses to announce such 
epidemic of horrors in order not to create a possible social 
pandemonium. Nonetheless, the bizarre facts remains that the clandestine
 and underground group of the Mexican Covenant known as "LA SANTA 
MUERTE", is to also be directly link to such malicious tragedies. <br><br>As
 such, the necessities for human-bodies are as a result of the drug 
Cartels of Juarez-Mexico across El Paso, Texas, which requires human 
sacrifices to satisfy their Black Sabbath rituals (demonology). 
Amazingly, the border crossing traveling into Juarez, Mexico from El 
Paso, Texas is notorious for contraband, since no one inspects any of 
the in-coming cargo from USA! With such brewing, people are still 
gullible and thinking that the Church Of Satan in Ca actually just 
lights up black candles and dress in black satin ropes for fun while 
chanting Hell Satan? Priceless...<br><br>Currently, there are hundreds 
of vogue organizations that are maliciously profiting from these cult 
crimes by requesting funds from gullible concern citizens in order to 
finance search-rescue-extractions; which they obviously don’t! Some even
 claim to be former Navy Seals, FBI and CIA operatives, while marketing 
and selling you “fairy tales” themes of cult crimes. These unscrupulous 
foundations profit from the suffering and misery of others like vultures
 and carnivorous Hyenas!!!<br><br>Sadly, as an expert Cult Investigator,
 I see many of these cases go unfounded; since Law Enforcement is quite 
restricted in infiltrating as under-covers into such surreptitious evil 
worshiping groups. In statistical comparison, in the State of Florida 
alone, there are over (30) thousand registered pedophiles which are not 
monitored, therefore this can also attribute to the sexual exploits of 
such perverts who later commit murder of their victims in order to 
conceal the abduction(s) (evidence). <br>On another note, the lack of 
emotional closure and psychological suffering of the victims families is
 beyond description, while simultaneously the lack of Law Enforcement 
funds to investigate these felony crimes; does actually contributes 
indirectly to these abduction nightmares. it doesn't take a 
criminologist or an academic anthropologist to find out what  is 
actually going on here! www.CharlesDelCampo.com  <br></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="934160180148313619" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-945384314"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=934160180148313619">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c934160180148313619-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c934160180148313619-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c934160180148313619-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="934160180148313619" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c934160180148313619-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6916392712998488899"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/08901151096227648394" rel="nofollow">Unknown</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1504061006086#c6916392712998488899">August 29, 2017 at 7:43 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">It
 has been said that Mr Aquino was not in the area for these crimes. The 
next thing that has been said is the some of the victims identified him

 the name of Gary Hambright was convicted and passed away with HIV. 
There was a boy that came back has positive for HIV with his preliminary
 test. This lead me to believe that Mr Hambright was involved in what

 Franklin Cover Up is still going strong as of today 4 July 2018!! Larry
 King's home (one of several) in Omaha was on Wirt Street. Testimony 
describes satanic rituals including pedophilia, torture, and animal and 
human sacrafice in that home. That house is still standing. Google 
street view shows it inhabitated and well cared for in 2018.<br>I called
 the Douglas County Assesors office in Omaha yesterday to inquire as to 
who pays the taxes on it. I was told no such house exists. The clerk was
 as shocked as I.<br>I then called the Registrar of Deeds of Douglas 
County to ask if Lawrence E. King  still owns the house. I was again 
told by the officials that no such house exists! Anyone can drive by 
there and see yes, it is indeed still standing and is inhabited and in 
fine shape. Are they Larry King's family I am wondering? My goodness, I 
would not want to live in that House of Horrors. </p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="743831183477518681" href="javascript:;">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-539505707"><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5841189008940050801&amp;postID=743831183477518681">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div id="c743831183477518681-rt" class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a target="_self" href="javascript:;">Replies</a></span></span><ol id="c743831183477518681-ra" class="thread-chrome thread-expanded"><div></div><div id="c743831183477518681-continue" class="continue"><a class="comment-reply" target="_self" data-comment-id="743831183477518681" href="javascript:;">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c743831183477518681-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c408712414793293625"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img src="Exposing%20the%20Truth%20The%20'Conspiracy'%20Against%20Michael%20Aquino%20%E2%80%93%20Satanic%20Pedophile_files/blogger_logo_round_35.png" alt=""></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/17961112604875469493" rel="nofollow">charles del campo</a></cite><span class="icon user "></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html?showComment=1560281814134#c408712414793293625">June 11, 2019 at 12:36 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">As
 an expert Cult Investigator I can say that many Satanic underground 
groups are still very active in the USA and UK. Regardless of how 
skeptical you can be on these secretive malefic lifestyles, these 
clandestine evil worshipers are highly trained in order not to be 
detected while abducting children for ritual sacrifices. The FBI and 
Interpol are well informed and aware of these horrific groups yet refuse
 to arrest and prosecute these menacing culprits! As such, I been 
involved in several search &amp; rescue operations of victims along 
their repatriations to their family members. See the below interview to

 wonder if he disappeared himself. President Trump is going hard after 
all the Deep State pedos and Aquino was certainly one of them. <br><br>Keep
 your eyes and ears on the news in the coming months. Many are going to 
fall. This human trafficking has been going on heavily all this time, 
and many high-profile people will go down. Jeffrey Epstein is just the 
opening act. Look at how Prince Andrew is so worried. Not acting at all 
like he's innocent. Same with Alan Dershowitz, who was recently going on
 TV trying to convince everyone that he's innocent of the allegations 
against him, and putting his foot in his mouth when he does.John
